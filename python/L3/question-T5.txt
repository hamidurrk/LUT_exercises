In this exercise, we will perform simple operations on strings. 
1. First the program asks for two words. Then, it compares these words according to the string 
comparison operation and prints the strings according to the order (see example runs). If the 
words are the same, print: “The words are the same.”. Remember that strings are compared in 
Python using the same operators as numbers. 
2. After this, your program should test whether the given words contain the character 'z'. If the 
letter 'z' is found in either of the words (or both!), the program outputs: "The <word> contains 
'z'." If the letter is not found, the program prints: "The letter 'z' was not found in either of the 
words." 
3. Finally, your program should ask for a third string and determine whether it is a palindrome. 
Palindrome is a word that can be read in the same way from beginning to end as from end to 
beginning. If the given word is palindrome, print "The <word> is a palindrome." If not, print 
"The <word> is not a palindrome."
